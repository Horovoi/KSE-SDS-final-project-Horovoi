# How much Ukrainian economy will contract?

My goal is to estimate a contraction of Ukrainian GDP due to russian invasion using various nowcasting models based on ML algorithms.

For this project, I use quarterly data on 17 macroeconomics indicators. Time series were seasonaly adjusted if necessary. Sources for the data are National Bank of Ukraine and State Statistical Service of Ukraine.

It is estimated that mean estimated Real GDP shrinkage in 2022 due to the war is -38.93% comparing to 2021.
